Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Analysis & Visualization
Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and business intelligence visualization.
The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them through an interactive dashboard and a clear, structured report.

Dataset

The dataset is loaded and processed using Python
Contains structured data suitable for exploratory and analytical tasks
Includes missing values, inconsistencies, and patterns that require cleaning and transformation
(Dataset source and description can be added here if applicable)

Tools & Technologies

Python – Data loading, EDA, and data cleaning

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

MySQL – Storing cleaned data and running SQL queries

Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation

Gamma AI – Presentation (PPT) generation

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis and documentation

Project Steps

Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas

Performed initial inspection (shape, data types, summary statistics)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships

Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies

Created visualizations to support findings

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing values and duplicates

Corrected data types and formatting issues

Prepared clean data for database insertion

SQL Analysis (MySQL)

Loaded cleaned data into a MySQL server

Wrote SQL queries to answer business and analytical questions

Aggregated and filtered data for reporting

Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard

Visualized key metrics, trends, and insights

Enabled easy filtering and exploration

Reporting & Presentation

Created a structured analytical report summarizing findings

Designed a professional presentation using Gamma AI

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Trend analysis and comparisons

Interactive filters for deeper exploration

(Screenshots or a Power BI link can be added here)

Results & Insights
